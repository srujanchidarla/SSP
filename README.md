Student Financial Wellness App

⸻

Description

This project is a student-focused financial wellness platform designed to help college students manage their finances more effectively while building financial literacy.

It combines:

	•	Expense Tracking (manual entry and optional bank integration)
	•	Student Loan Management & Education (loan dashboard, repayment calculator, financial concepts explained by AI)
	•	Discounts & Scholarships Feed (aggregated student-specific offers)
	•	AI Chatbot (Core Feature) → An intelligent assistant that answers student financial questions, integrates with user data, and provides personalized insights.

⸻

Key Features
	•	Track income and expenses with categories and visual dashboards.
	•	Manage student loans with repayment simulations and forecasting.
	•	Get real-time student discounts and curated scholarship info.
	•	Ask questions via an AI-powered chatbot (OpenAI GPT-4o) for:
	•	Spending summaries (“How much did I spend on books last month?”)
	•	Loan advice (“What happens if I pay $100 more per month?”)
	•	Offers (“Any food discounts available this week?”)
	•	Cloud-deployed web app with responsive front-end design.

	•	Database Design → PostgreSQL schema for users, expenses, loans, offers
	•	AI Integration → OpenAI GPT-4o chatbot, connecting data to LLM
	•	Cloud & DevOps → AWS/GCP deployment, Dockerization
	•	Project Management → Weekly progress tracked in Notion + GitHub commits

How to Run the Project (Midterm Delivery)
⸻

Cost Breakdown (Estimated)
	•	OpenAI GPT-4o API: $0.01 per advanced request ($5–10/month for demo use).
	•	Plaid Sandbox: Free for testing.
	•	AWS/GCP Cloud (Student Credits): $0 (using free tier or credits).
	•	Frontend Hosting (Vercel/Netlify): Free tier.
	•	Domain (Optional): $10–15/year.

Total Estimated Cost for MVP: ~$15–25/month (mostly AI usage).

⸻

Business Use Case
	•	Students struggle with irregular income, complex loan terms, and overspending.
	•	Current apps (Mint, YNAB, Rocket Money) assume financial literacy and stable income.
	•	Differentiator:
	•	Education-first: AI explains financial terms.
	•	Student-specific: Loans, scholarships, student discounts.
	•	Proactive: Chatbot gives reminders, insights, and advice instead of passive dashboards.
